## Project Item Breakdown
Proposal
  You need to propose a topic for the project. 10% will be subtracted from project grade if not completed.
Progress Report
  You need to write 1-2 pages on the progress of the project.
Presentation
  Due to a rather high number of enrollments, we canâ€™t have project presentations during the lecture. Hence, you need to record your presentation (e.g., using Zoom) and upload it to the course website. This way, all students can watch the presentation offline and be informed of other projects. The uploaded presentation will be graded.
Final Report & Code/Materials
  You need to write a final report in a research paper format about the project. You also need to submit your code and other materials.
